        <h2>Landscape Gardening</h2>

        <p>Our garden is an extension of our family living space, a place for relaxation, entertaining and enjoyment. There are many aspects to garden landscaping including paving, decking, walling and turfing.</p>

        <h3>Patios</h3>

        <p>We provide all types of patios in a variety of materials ranging from natural sandstone, concrete products to slate. We will design and construct your ideal patio to meet your individual requirements and create a design to your chosen size, shape and budget.
            Introducing a patio to your garden provides a place to entertain or space to simply sit back and relax. Spring into Autumn create all types of patio using a vast choice of materials ranging from natural sandstone, slate to a large collection of concrete products.
            Preparation is key to a long lasting patio and that is why all our paving is laid to exact specification*.
            Your patio can be built to any shape or size to suit both your lifestyle and your garden space.
            Make the most of small spaces by creating a compact patio area with a small table and chairs.
            Split level patio areas are great for defining different areas in your garden.
            Blend stone with aggregates to bring a mix of textures and colours.
            Choose materials to compliment your property or create contrast for impact.
            Please see some of our patio projects above for ideas and a variety of product ranges.</p>

        <p>Paths to connect your outdoor space or simply meandering to that favourite spot in the garden, we can create any design of path with a huge choice of materials to choose from including stone, gravel, timber, to grass…the choice is yours.
            Paths are more than just a way of linking one place to another, pathways can be the heart and soul of a garden. Their installation gives direction to a space, defines its edges, leads the way to a focal point or simply makes access to all of the plantings much easier.
            The materials used to create a path also lend a degree of personality to a garden from gravel crunching under foot to stone slabs giving a feeling of solidity.
            We can create a design for you to suit your needs or bring your own garden ideas into creation.

            A well laid lawn offers many benefits, whether it forms a colourful centre piece to the whole garden, somewhere to lie and relax or a safe play ground for your children.
            Laying a new lawn or sowing grass seed requires some careful preparation ensuring a level and graded platform for your new turf or grass seed. Our team of professionals will prepare and carefully lay turf or sow grass seed providing you with a great looking and hardwearing lawn.
            Ongoing care is vital to the success of your new lawn and we would recommend that newly laid turf should not be cut until the turf roots have knitted into the soil. Initial mowing of new lawns should be light, never cut grass too short as this can damage the grass plant, “little and often” is best. Regular mowing, feeding and weeding will ensure your lawn remains in top condition.
            Spring into Autumn provide local grass cutting services within approximately 15 miles of Perth</p>

        <h3>Garden Features</h3>

        <p>Why not introduce a feature to your garden, this can add interest or simply create a variation to your existing garden design. Whether it’s a water feature, a summer house or a quiet seat in the garden there are many features to choose from.
            Garden features can enhance the most basic of gardens; how about introducing a terrace or patio in a quiet area of your garden for winding down in after a busy day? Or perhaps you'd like to introduce a scented border or build an architectural scheme out of your favourite plants.

        <p>We supply and construct a range of pergolas, arbours and arches available in an extensive range of materials, designs and finishes…offering an interesting and stylish addition to your garden space.
            Arches are a versatile way of introducing height and interest to your garden. Used as an elegant gateway, to link one area of the garden to another or as a beautiful frame to an urn, fountain or statue. They can also provide decorative support for climbing plants such as clematis, honeysuckle and roses.
            Pergolas create a distinctive focal point to the garden reflecting your individual style. They are a very popular choice today and are ideally suited for linking different parts of the garden. Their open aspect makes them particularly effective in smaller gardens where more solid shapes like walls or fences can make the space feel more cluttered.
            An arbour is an open structure and normally encloses a seat. Arbours can make romantic focal points in a quiet spot of the garden or the meeting point of two paths. They are an ideal solution in creating that perfect secluded spot to sit quietly and relax.
            We can provide arches, pergolas and arbours to suit all tastes, available in an extensive range of materials, styles and finishes.</p>

        <h3>Summer Houses and Sheds</h3>

        <p>We provide a variety of summer houses and sheds to suit all garden spaces, styles and budgets. More importantly, we will produce a solid level base to place your summer house or shed, ensuring your investment is secure.
            A summer house is a lovely addition to the garden, not only does it present a wonderful focal point but also offers a sheltered spot to sit, relax and enjoy the view of your garden.
            A summer house will also allow you to enjoy your garden in the cooler months when it would simply be too cold to sit outdoors.
            If you are looking for garden storage, a place to work or additional space, garden sheds could be the solution.
            There are many different types of summer houses and sheds available to suit individual requirements, tastes and budget.
            Once you have chosen your summer house or shed we will create a safe and level base for this to be positioned on* providing many years of life to your investment.</p>

        <h3>Garden Lighting</h3>

        <p>Why not add those finishing touches to your garden by introducing garden lighting? Whether considering a new landscaping project or enhancing your existing garden, garden lighting will promote the enjoyment of your garden all year round.
            Make the most of your garden with well placed outdoor lighting and enjoy your garden all year round.
            Whether highlighting favourite features in your garden, illuminating pathways and entrances, or simply to brighten up outside entertainment areas there are many types and styles of lighting to choose from.
            If you are considering a landscaping project it is always worth thinking about introducing lighting, our team can bury cables safely according to your choice of design and requirements rather than disrupt your garden later.  Garden lighting really can add the finishing touch to your project.</p>

        <h3>Garden Planting Services</h3>

        <p>Well designed and chosen planting can really add those finishing touches or wow factor to your garden. Every garden is different so dependent on the light and shade in your garden and soil type, this will assist in choosing the most appropriate types of plants and planting layout.
            It’s important that you take time to think about what you would like to create, you might consider:

            <ul>
                <li>Wildlife Garden – this might include planting nectar rich flowers or berry producing shrubs which will enhance the opportunities for wildlife with a mixture of textures, colours, and structure.</li>
                <li>Easier Maintenance – choosing plants that are easier to keep and don’t require too much attention.</li>
                <li>Water Garden – bringing the element of water to the garden along with a mixture of water plants.</li>
                <li>Scented Garden – offering a fragrant mix of coloured and scented plants and flowers.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Sensory Gardens</h3>

        <p>Any garden we design, by its sheer nature, should excite and indulge our senses; the difference with a sensory garden is that it is specifically designed to personally engage the senses of the occupants that use it.
            Sensory gardens should be communally enjoyed by all but should also provide an individual experience for each and every visitor. These gardens are prevalently used as havens for individuals with impaired senses or those with physical or mental disabilities. They are also commonly designed to aid the mental development of children. Sensory gardens can be calming, exciting, entertaining and surprising and are increasingly used as an alternative form of therapy for people with a variety of heath complications.
            Whether you are designing a sensory garden from scratch, or redeveloping an existing garden to be more sensory-rich, Spring into Autumn can support and enrich your experience. We have the knowledge to help you develop and design a sensory garden that is suited to your needs and exceeds your expectations of what a garden traditionally should and can offer.
            Here at Spring into Autumn we're devoted to providing you with a unique and personalised experience. In order to do that we’re delighted to offer you as much useful information on sensory gardens as we possibly can so that you are efficiently informed when you are ready to start designing your sensory garden.</p>
